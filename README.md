# Car-Fuel-Consumption-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict a car's fuel consumption based on various vehicle features such as engine size, transmission type, and vehicle class. The goal is to predict the combined fuel consumption (in liters per 100 kilometers) for a given car based on the given input features.
